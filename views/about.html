    <div class="about">
      <p class="example">Hi, I'm Zach J Murphy. I am from Canada, and I like to mess around with photography as a hobby.
        My favourite
        thing to do is listen to music on Spotify.
        <br><br>
        I have messed about with almost everything from programming, working with photoshop, and doing photography as a
        hobby.
        <br><br>
        When I am not messing around with my computer, I like to go on long distance runs, study 17th Century & 18th
        Century history, debate politics & economics, and go canoeing.
        <br><br>
        On this website, you can find out about my projects, some of my writings which include various stories,
        tutorials and opinions.
        I'm always up for a good talk, so if you want to talk about anything, then you can find my social media links to
        the left of this text, or above if you're on mobile.
